<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What makes this Polish potato soup extraordinary is the addition of chopped dill pickle, pickle juice, and plenty of fresh dill. These ingredients, plus tangy sour cream, create a delicious, complex, comforting potato soup. I find it a comforting soup to eat, but the true comfort, the true relaxation comes from the process of making the soup.</p>

    <p>This Polish potato soup is dedicated to my grandmother Sofie. She passed away when I was very young, but even though I never learned any recipes directly from her, I feel like she passed along some great Polish food-making genes, which is maybe why this soup came out so good. Can you inherit cooking skills? Probably a topic for another post, but the point is, this soup is amazing. I truly believe “Grandma New York,” as we called her, would have loved it. </p>

    <p>I love the small, but very effective, kielbasa addition in this soup. If you want to make it meatless, some very well caramelized mushrooms would be a great substitute. The other decision is whether to bother with the two potato additions — you heard my official recommendation in the video, so you’ll have to make that call. Either way this is rustic, comfort food at its finest, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces Polish kielbasa sausage, quartered and sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup diced dill pickle</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickle juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh dill, divided</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>

<H2>Directions</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat and add kielbasa. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes to flavor the oil. Add onions, celery, and carrots, and cook, stirring, until onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, quarter potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. Transfer about 1/3 of the potatoes into cold water, and reserve in the refrigerator until needed. Stir remaining sliced potatoes into the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Add broth, water, salt, pepper, cayenne, pickles, pickle juice, and half the fresh chopped dill. Raise the heat to high, and wait for soup to start to simmer. While soup is coming up to temperature, stir in sour cream.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Use a potato masher to break up potatoes.</li>
        <li>Drain and add the reserved sliced potatoes, and let soup simmer until potatoes are very soft and tender, about 40 to 45 minutes more. During the last 30 minutes, be careful to stir gently to maintain whole pieces of potato.</li>
        <li>Taste for seasoning and adjust. Stir in remaining dill, and serve immediately, garnished with more sour cream and dill.</li>
